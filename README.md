<h1>[Mini] Filter an SQL Query</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab example, I run through how to filter an SQL query. I'll be applying basic filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a MariaDB database. <br/>
MariaDB is a popular open source relational database that is compatible with MySQL.
<br/>
<Br/>
At the end of this lab, I have practical experience in using SQL to: <br/>
- apply the "WHERE" clause to filter what a SQL query returns, and <br/>
- use the "LIKE" operator to filter for patterns.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>MariaDB database</b> 
- <b>Oracle VM Virtual Box</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> (22H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Launch the utility: <br/>
For this scenario, I'm finding more information about commands that I need to use. <br/>
I also need to discover which command to use to perform a certain task. <br/>
First, I'll explore a few commands I can use in the shell to learn more about other commands. <br/>
Next, I'll find an option i need to add to a command. <br/>
Third, I'll use a command to get a brief description of command so I can identify their differences. <br/>
Finally, I'll identify the command I need to perform a task. <br/>
